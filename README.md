# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier in Python

## Overview
This repository contains implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm from scratch in Python. 

This project demonstrates how KNN can be implemented using `numpy` library. It also shows ways to create synthetic data and assess model performance using `sklearn`.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
